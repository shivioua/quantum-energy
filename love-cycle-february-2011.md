Love Cycle is a special chapter of the Quantum Energy series, recorded in February 2011 — just before Valentine’s Day and shortly after a beautiful New Year’s Eve spent in Cracow, followed by a snowy snowboard escape with family and friends to Białka Tatrzańska.

This set reflects that moment in time: full of love, warmth, motion and connection. It’s a personal time capsule capturing post-holiday emotions and pre-Valentine anticipation, translated into bass, melody and rhythm.

Expect a dynamic journey through drum and bass, blending liquid, neurofunk and energetic vibes — from emotional atmospheres to powerful drops and raw energy.
